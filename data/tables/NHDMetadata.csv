During this combination any of the 1-D features with the same feature type were snapped  together using a user specified tolerance.

51,27367,27367," Create high-resolution NHD from revised DLG data.  This  process started with published 1:24,000-scale USGS DLG hydrography files and used DOQs to revise the data.  Features  were modified to the DOQ only where compelling evidence of  change existed. DLG files were converted to ArcInfo coverages  and projected to a common projection (Albers NAD83 meters).   Coverages were then panelled into one coverage and arcs within  12 meters of each other along the neatline were snapped together if the feature type were the same.  Next, the 11-digit Hydrologic  Unit Code (HUC) boundary was obtained from the state NRCS office.   The HUC boundary was projected to the Albers projection and used  to extract features from the paneled coverage that fell partially  or entirely within the boundary.  Where necessary, the HUC  boundary was slightly modified to completely include or exclude features that incorrectly overlapped the boundary.  Substantial alterations to the HUC boundary were confirmed on the topographic maps. Next, arcs from the extracted coverage were grouped in  order to examine the connectivity of the data set for flow  determination.  In some cases it was necessary to correct  digitizing errors.  Using available evidence or cartographic  judgement, lines called connectors were added to join features  that were deemed to have flow between each other.  All arcs were  directed downstream and the nodes were prepared to help create  artificial paths through 2-D waterbodies and complete the flow through the hydrography network.  The artificial path coverage  was combined with the single line stream network to create the drainage network.  The drainage network was grouped again, and  each group was directed downstream.  Feature codes (fcodes) were assigned to landmark, network, waterbody features through a  crosswalk that converts DLG-3 attributes to fcodes, where an  fcode is a five digit integer that encodes a set of feature type characteristics.  Reach codes and associated attributes were  conflated from the 100K NHD data to the 24K drainage network  and 2-D waterbodies.  Several checks were performed to validate  the reach transfer process.Any reach codes that could not be  maintained are tracked in the Reach Cross Reference table.  New reaches that do not exist in the 100K data were defined  according to reach delineation rules (See  http://nhd.usgs.gov/chapter1/index.html).  New waterbody reaches were assigned to 2-D lake/pond and reservoir features that do not exist in the 100K NHD.  New reaches were assigned reach code values  that are sequentially ordered to 2-D and then 1-D reaches.  New 24K reach codes are larger than any existing 100K reach code in the associated Catalog Unit. Additional Geographic Names that  exist in the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) were added  to reaches in the 24K dataset. Names for the 24K drainage network  were interactively transferred from the vector GNIS coverage.   Additional GNIS names for point and waterbody features were also  added.

Features were modified to the  DOQ only where compelling evidence of change existed.  DLG files  were converted to ArcInfo coverages and projected to a common  projection (Albers, NAD83, meters).  Coverages were then paneled  into one coverage and arcs within 12 meters of each other along  the neatline were snapped together if the feature types were the  same.  Next, the 10-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) boundary was  obtained from the State NRCS office.  The HUC boundary was  projected to the Albers projection and used to extract features  from the paneled coverage that fell partially or entirely within  the boundary.  Where necessary, the HUC boundary was slightly  modified to completely include or exclude features that  incorrectly overlapped the boundary.  Substantial alterations to  the HUC boundary were confirmed on the topographic maps.

Using either  Kansas Geological Survey's (KGS) digital line graph (DLG) for UTM  or standard USGS 7.5' quadrangles as backdrop for extent, streams  were digitized from 1:12,000-scale DOQs.  Only stream placement was  digitized.  Care was taken to ensure that stream direction was taken  into account when digitizing.  The only extent that was updated from  the backdrop was disappearing streams.  All disappearing streams  that are contained in the backdrop, but contained a definite  drainage channel on the DOQ, were connected to the major stream.   If there was any question as to stream placement, the backdrop was  strictly adhered to.  Double line streams were digitized from the  backdrop even if streams were covered with trees.  Double line  streams were attributed according to stream direction either as the  left bank or the right bank.  Double line streams next to the State  line were digitized as one bank (according to direction) with a  digitized centerline (attributed as perennial), in order to close  the polygon.  Sandbar islands were not digitized, but shallow  sandbars were included as part of the stream channel.  All islands  that could be seen at 1:4800-scale on the DOQs were digitized and  attributed as perennial.  All ponds, that could be seen at 1:4800- scale on the DOQs and were greater that 0.5 acres, were digitized.   Ponds that were on the backdrop, but could not be seen on the DOQs,  were not digitized.  Ponds were digitized from DOQs at their  perennial water level.  Sewage lagoons were digitized from DOQs at  a scale of 1:4800.  The lagoons were labeled as man-made and were  coded	as lagoon.  Agricultural waste systems were digitized if there  was a distinct, confined livestock area with a defined lagoon  structure.  Agricultural waste ponds were coded as man-made and  labeled as lagoon.  Quarries were digitized if there was either:  a distinct environment conclusive to quarries, as seen on the DOQs,  or after referring to USGS 7.5' quadrangles and the area in question  had at one time contained a quarry.  Quarries were coded as man-made  and were labeled as water.  Industrial ponds were digitized, if they  were contained in an urban, industrial environment.  Industrial ponds  were coded as man-made and labeled as water.  Ditches were digitized  if backdrop included the ditches in	their layer.  Canals were  digitized if backdrop was conclusive to a stream.  Wetlands were not  digitized unless specifically displayed on USGS 7.5' quadrangles as  a large, contiguous wetland with a size greater than 0.5 acres.   Wetlands were coded as natural and labeled as water.  The stream  digitizing was documented in the following ways:  backcover  quadrangle date and photorevision data, digitized completion date,  and estimated time of completion.  All hydrography was check plotted  at the 7.5' quad format and was overlaid on USGS 7.5' quadrangle maps  to ensure:  hydrography placement, hydrography direction, and  hydrography type.  Through on-screen checks, the following were  checked:  edge-match problems, dangles, pseudo nodes, sliver polygons,  multiple labels, and built topology.  All quads were spot checked by  an inner office review.  Automated procedures checked for the  following errors:  polygon, and line topology, multiple label points  within a polygon, unlabeled polygons, pseudo nodes, dangling nodes,  sliver polygons, and edge matching.  Features were modified to the  DOQ only where compelling evidence of change existed.  DLG files  were converted to ArcInfo coverages and projected to a common  projection (Albers, NAD83, meters).  Coverages were then paneled  into one coverage and arcs within 12 meters of each other along the  neatline were snapped together if the feature types were the same.   Next, the 10-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) boundary was obtained  from the State NRCS office.

Substantial alterations to the HUC boundary were  confirmed on the topographic maps.  Next, arcs from the extracted  coverage were grouped in order to examine the connectivity of the  dataset for flow determination.  In some cases it was necessary  to correct digitizing errors.  Using available evidence or  cartographic judgment, lines called connectors were added to join  features that were determined to have flow between each other.   All arcs were directed downstream and nodes were prepared to help  create artificial paths through 2-D waterbodies and complete the  flow through the hydrography network.  The artificial path  coverage was combined with the single line stream network to  create the drainage network.  The drainage network was grouped  again, and each group was directed downstream.

94,31735,31735,"Create high-resolution NHD from revised DLG data.  This process  started with published 1:24,000-scale USGS hydrography DLG files  and used DOQs to revise the data.  Features were modified to the  DOQ only where compelling evidence of change existed.  DLG files  were converted to ArcInfo coverages and projected to a common  projection (Albers, NAD83, meters).  Coverages were then paneled  into one coverage and arcs within 12 meters of each other along  the neatline were snapped together if the feature types were the  same.  Next, the 10-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) boundary was  obtained from the State NRCS office.  The HUC boundary was  projected to Albers and used to extract features from the paneled  coverage that fell partially or entirely within the boundary.   Where necessary, the HUC boundary was slightly modified to  completely include or exclude features that incorrectly overlapped  the boundary.  Substantial alterations to the HUC boundary were  confirmed on the topographic maps.  Next, arcs from the extracted  coverage were grouped in order to examine the connectivity of the  dataset for flow determination.  In some cases it was necessary  to correct digitizing errors.  Using available evidence or  cartographic judgment, lines called connectors were added to join  features that were determined to have flow between each other.   All arcs were directed downstream and nodes were prepared to help  create artificial paths through 2-D waterbodies and complete the  flow through the hydrography network.  The artificial path  coverage was combined with the single line stream network to  create the drainage network.  The drainage network was grouped  again, and each group was directed downstream.  Feature codes  (fcodes) were assigned to landmark, network, waterbody features  through a crosswalk that converts DLG attributes to fcodes, where  an fcode is a five digit integer that encodes a set of feature  type characteristics.  Reach codes and associated attributes were  conflated from the 100K NHD data to the 24K drainage network and  2-D waterbodies.  Several checks were performed to validate the  reach transfer process.  Any reach codes that could not be  maintained are tracked in the Reach Cross Reference table (RCL).   New reaches that do not exist in the 100K data were defined  according to reach delineation rules (See http://nhd.usgs.gov/ chapter1/index.html).  New waterbody reaches were assigned to 2-D  lake/pond and reservoir features that do not exist in the 100K NHD.

One or more of  the following methods were used to test attribute accuracy:  manual comparison of the source with hardcopy plots;  symbolized display of the digital line graph on an  interactive computer graphic system; selected attributes  that could not be visually verified on plots or on screen  were interactively queried and verified on screen. In  addition, software validated feature types and  characteristics against a master set of types and  characteristics,checked that combinations of types and  characteristics were valid, and that types and  characteristics were valid for the delineation of the  feature. Feature types, characteristics, and other  attributes conform to the Standards for National  Hydrography Dataset - High Resolution (USGS, 1999) as of  the date they were loaded into the database. All names  on the 1:24,000-scale reaches were validated against a  April 1999 extract from the Geographic Names Information  System. The entry and identifier for the names match those  in the Geographic Names Information System. The association  of each name to reaches has been interactively checked  against the April 1999 Geographic Names Information System  names extract, however, operator error could in some cases  apply a name to a wrong reach.","For DLG data, points, nodes, lines, and areas conform to  topological rules. Lines intersect only at nodes, and all nodes  anchor the ends of lines.  Lines do not overshoot or undershoot  other lines where they are supposed to meet. There are no duplicate  lines. Lines bound areas and lines identify the areas to the left  and right of the lines.  Gaps and overlaps among areas do not  exist.  All areas close. The CFF data is converted to DLG form in  order to make the data topologically structured.","The completeness of the data reflects the published USGS  topographic quadrangle and/or the U.S. Forest Service Primary Base Series (PBS) map. The USGS topographic quadrangle is usually  supplemented by Digital Orthophoto Quadrangles(DOQ's). Features  found on the ground may have been eliminated or generalized on the  source map because of scale and legibility constraints.  In  general, streams longer than one mile (approximately 1.6 kilometers) were collected. Most streams that flow from a lake were collected  regardless of their length.  Only definite channels were collected  so not all swamp/marsh features have stream/rivers delineated  through them.  Lake/ponds 100 feet or greater in the shortest  axis were collected.  Note, however, that these general rules  were applied unevenly among maps during compilation.  Transport reaches are defined on nearly all features of type  stream/river, canal/ditch, artificial path, and connector.   Waterbody reaches are defined on all lake/pond features. Detailed  capture conditions are provided for every feature type in the  Standards for National Hydrography Dataset - High Resolution  (USGS, 1999), available online through  http://mapping.usgs.gov/standards/.","Statements of horizontal positional accuracy are based on  accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic  quadrangle maps. These maps were compiled to meet National Map  Accuracy Standards. For horizontal accuracy, this standard is  met if at least 90 percent of points tested are within 0.02  inch (at map scale) of the true position.  Additional offsets  to positions may have been introduced where feature density is  high to improve the legibility of map symbols.In addition, the  digitizing of maps is estimated to contain a horizontal  positional error of less than or equal to 0.003 inch standard  error(at map scale) in the two component directions relative  to the source maps.  Visual comparison between the map graphic  (including digital scans of the graphic) and plots or digital  displays of points, lines, and areas, is used as control to  assess the positional accuracy of digital data. Digital map  elements along the adjoining edges of data sets are aligned if  they are within a 0.02 inch tolerance (at map scale). Features  with like dimensionality (for example, features that all are  delineated with lines), with or without like characteristics,  that are within the tolerance are aligned by moving the  features equally to a common point. Features outside the  tolerance are not moved; instead, a feature of type connector  is added to join the features.","Statements of vertical positional accuracy for elevation of  water surfaces are  based on accuracy statements made for  U.S. Geological Survey topographicquadrangle maps.  These  maps were compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards.   For vertical accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90  percent of well-defined points tested are within one-half  contour interval of the correct value.  Elevations of water  surface printed on the published map meet this standard;  the contour intervals of the maps vary. These elevations  were transcribed into the digital data; the accuracy of  this transcription was checked by visual comparison between  the data and the map.",None,FGDC-STD-001-1998,12/18/2006,U.S. Geological Survey,U.S. Geological Survey,Mailing and Physical Address,"U.S. Geological Survey, National Geospatial Technical Operations Center, P.O.

Coverages were then panelled into one coverage and arcs within  12 meters of each other along the neatline were snapped together if the feature type were the same.  Next, the 11-digit Hydrologic  Unit Code (HUC) boundary was obtained from the state NRCS office.   The HUC boundary was projected to the Albers projection and used  to extract features from the paneled coverage that fell partially  or entirely within the boundary.  Where necessary, the HUC  boundary was slightly modified to completely include or exclude features that incorrectly overlapped the boundary.  Substantial alterations to the HUC boundary were confirmed on the topographic maps. Next, arcs from the extracted coverage were grouped in  order to examine the connectivity of the data set for flow  determination.  In some cases it was necessary to correct  digitizing errors.  Using available evidence or cartographic  judgement, lines called connectors were added to join features  that were deemed to have flow between each other.

Coverages were then panelled into one coverage and arcs within  12 meters of each other along the neatline were snapped together if the feature type were the same.  Next, the 11-digit Hydrologic  Unit Code (HUC) boundary was obtained from the state NRCS office.   The HUC boundary was projected to the Albers projection and used  to extract features from the paneled coverage that fell partially  or entirely within the boundary.  Where necessary, the HUC  boundary was slightly modified to completely include or exclude features that incorrectly overlapped the boundary.  Substantial alterations to the HUC boundary were confirmed on the topographic maps. Next, arcs from the extracted coverage were grouped in  order to examine the connectivity of the data set for flow  determination.  In some cases it was necessary to correct  digitizing errors.  Using available evidence or cartographic  judgement, lines called connectors were added to join features  that were deemed to have flow between each other.

208,27570,27570," Create high-resolution NHD from revised DLG data and U.S. Forest Service Cartographic Feature Files (CFF).  This process started  with  1:24,000-scale U.S. Forest Service hydrography Cartographic Feature Files and 1:24,000-scale published USGS DLG hydrography  files. The CFF files and DLG files were converted to ArcInfo coverages  and projected to a common projection (Albers NAD83 meters).   Coverages were then panelled into one coverage and arcs within  12 meters of each other along the neatline were snapped together if the feature type were the same.  Next, the 11-digit Hydrologic  Unit Code (HUC) boundary was obtained from the state NRCS office.   The HUC boundary was projected to the Albers projection and used  to extract features from the paneled coverage that fell partially  or entirely within the boundary.  Where necessary, the HUC  boundary was slightly modified to completely include or exclude features that incorrectly overlapped the boundary.  Substantial alterations to the HUC boundary were confirmed on the topographic maps. Next, arcs from the extracted coverage were grouped in  order to examine the connectivity of the data set for flow  determination.  In some cases it was necessary to correct  digitizing errors.  Using available evidence or cartographic  judgement, lines called connectors were added to join features  that were deemed to have flow between each other.  All arcs were  directed downstream and the nodes were prepared to help create  artificial paths through 2-D waterbodies and complete the flow through the hydrography network.  The artificial path coverage  was combined with the single line stream network to create the drainage network.  The drainage network was grouped again, and  each group was directed downstream.  Feature codes (fcodes) were assigned to landmark, network, waterbody features through a  crosswalk that converts DLG-3 attributes to fcodes, where an  fcode is a five digit integer that encodes a set of feature type characteristics.  Reach codes and associated attributes were  conflated from the 100K NHD data to the 24K drainage network  and 2-D waterbodies.  Several checks were performed to validate  the reach transfer process.Any reach codes that could not be  maintained are tracked in the Reach Cross Reference table.  New reaches that do not exist in the 100K data were defined  according to reach delineation rules (See  http://nhd.usgs.gov/chapter1/index.html).  New waterbody reaches were assigned to 2-D lake/pond and reservoir features that do not exist in the 100K NHD.  New reaches were assigned reach code values  that are sequentially ordered to 2-D and then 1-D reaches.  New 24K reach codes are larger than any existing 100K reach code in the associated Catalog Unit. Additional Geographic Names that  exist in the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) were added  to reaches in the 24K dataset. Names for the 24K drainage network  were interactively transferred from the vector GNIS coverage.   Additional GNIS names for point and waterbody features were also  added.    ",12/13/2002," The accuracy of the attributes of the source Digital Line  Graph data is estimated to be 98.5 percent.

219,27963,27963," Create high-resolution NHD from revised DLG data.  This  process started with published 1:24,000-scale USGS DLG hydrography files and used DOQs to revise the data.  Features  were modified to the DOQ only where compelling evidence of  change existed. DLG files were converted to ArcInfo coverages  and projected to a common projection (Albers NAD83 meters).   Coverages were then panelled into one coverage and arcs within  12 meters of each other along the neatline were snapped together if the feature type were the same.  Next, the 11-digit Hydrologic  Unit Code (HUC) boundary was obtained from the state NRCS office.   The HUC boundary was projected to the Albers projection and used  to extract features from the paneled coverage that fell partially  or entirely within the boundary.  Where necessary, the HUC  boundary was slightly modified to completely include or exclude features that incorrectly overlapped the boundary.  Substantial alterations to the HUC boundary were confirmed on the topographic maps. Next, arcs from the extracted coverage were grouped in  order to examine the connectivity of the data set for flow  determination.  In some cases it was necessary to correct  digitizing errors.  Using available evidence or cartographic  judgement, lines called connectors were added to join features  that were deemed to have flow between each other.  All arcs were  directed downstream and the nodes were prepared to help create  artificial paths through 2-D waterbodies and complete the flow through the hydrography network.  The artificial path coverage  was combined with the single line stream network to create the drainage network.  The drainage network was grouped again, and  each group was directed downstream.  Feature codes (fcodes) were assigned to landmark, network, waterbody features through a  crosswalk that converts DLG-3 attributes to fcodes, where an  fcode is a five digit integer that encodes a set of feature type characteristics.  Reach codes and associated attributes were  conflated from the 100K NHD data to the 24K drainage network  and 2-D waterbodies.  Several checks were performed to validate  the reach transfer process.Any reach codes that could not be  maintained are tracked in the Reach Cross Reference table.  New reaches that do not exist in the 100K data were defined  according to reach delineation rules (See  http://nhd.usgs.gov/chapter1/index.html).  New waterbody reaches were assigned to 2-D lake/pond and reservoir features that do not exist in the 100K NHD.  New reaches were assigned reach code values  that are sequentially ordered to 2-D and then 1-D reaches.  New 24K reach codes are larger than any existing 100K reach code in the associated Catalog Unit. Additional Geographic Names that  exist in the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) were added  to reaches in the 24K dataset. Names for the 24K drainage network  were interactively transferred from the vector GNIS coverage.   Additional GNIS names for point and waterbody features were also  added.

These files were then edited to remove any conversion errors and to add any required centerlines.  Once all of the Hi-resolution datasets were generated then a  Hi-resolution CU was created using one of two paths.  The first path loaded all of the quad NHD datasets into the FOD and then unloaded a Hi-resolution CU dataset. The second path used FTI to generate the Hi-resolution CU by combining the quad based datasets into a single CU dataset. During this combination any of the 1-D features with the same feature type were snapped  together using a user specified tolerance. After combining the datasets, all of the features that fall outside the 100K HUC boundary were removed. At this point any additional connectors were added to the data.

249,30122,30122,"Create high-resolution NHD from revised DLG data.  This process  started with published 1:24,000-scale USGS hydrography DLG files  and used DOQs to revise the data.  Features were modified to the  DOQ only where compelling evidence of change existed.  DLG files  were converted to ArcInfo coverages and projected to a common  projection (Albers, NAD83, meters).  Coverages were then paneled  into one coverage and arcs within 12 meters of each other along  the neatline were snapped together if the feature types were the  same.  Next, the 10-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) boundary was  obtained from the State NRCS office.  The HUC boundary was  projected to Albers and used to extract features from the paneled  coverage that fell partially or entirely within the boundary.   Where necessary, the HUC boundary was slightly modified to  completely include or exclude features that incorrectly overlapped  the boundary.  Substantial alterations to the HUC boundary were  confirmed on the topographic maps.  Next, arcs from the extracted  coverage were grouped in order to examine the connectivity of the  dataset for flow determination.  In some cases it was necessary  to correct digitizing errors.  Using available evidence or  cartographic judgment, lines called connectors were added to join  features that were determined to have flow between each other.

253,30600,30600,"Create high-resolution NHD from revised DLG data and U.S. Forest Service Cartographic Feature Files (CFF).  This process started  with  1:24,000-scale U.S. Forest Service hydrography Cartographic Feature Files and 1:24,000-scale published USGS DLG hydrography  files. The CFF files and DLG files were converted to ArcInfo coverages  and projected to a common projection (Albers NAD83 meters).   Coverages were then panelled into one coverage and arcs within  12 meters of each other along the neatline were snapped together if the feature type were the same.  Next, the 10-digit Hydrologic  Unit Code (HUC) boundary was obtained from the state NRCS office.   The HUC boundary was projected to the Albers projection and used  to extract features from the paneled coverage that fell partially  or entirely within the boundary.  Where necessary, the HUC  boundary was slightly modified to completely include or exclude features that incorrectly overlapped the boundary.  Substantial alterations to the HUC boundary were confirmed on the topographic maps. Next, arcs from the extracted coverage were grouped in  order to examine the connectivity of the data set for flow  determination.  In some cases it was necessary to correct  digitizing errors.  Using available evidence or cartographic  judgement, lines called connectors were added to join features  that were deemed to have flow between each other.  All arcs were  directed downstream and the nodes were prepared to help create  artificial paths through 2-D waterbodies and complete the flow through the hydrography network.  The artificial path coverage  was combined with the single line stream network to create the drainage network.  The drainage network was grouped again, and  each group was directed downstream.  Feature codes (fcodes) were assigned to landmark, network, waterbody features through a  crosswalk that converts DLG-3 attributes to fcodes, where an  fcode is a five digit integer that encodes a set of feature type characteristics.  Reach codes and associated attributes were  conflated from the 100K NHD data to the 24K drainage network  and 2-D waterbodies.

356,44617,31577,"Create high-resolution NHD from revised DLG data.  This process  started with published 1:24,000-scale USGS hydrography DLG files  and used DOQs to revise the data.  Features were modified to the  DOQ only where compelling evidence of change existed.  DLG files  were converted to ArcInfo coverages and projected to a common  projection (Albers, NAD83, meters).  Coverages were then paneled  into one coverage and arcs within 12 meters of each other along  the neatline were snapped together if the feature types were the  same.  Next, the 10-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) boundary was  obtained from the State NRCS office.  The HUC boundary was  projected to Albers and used to extract features from the paneled  coverage that fell partially or entirely within the boundary.   Where necessary, the HUC boundary was slightly modified to  completely include or exclude features that incorrectly overlapped  the boundary.  Substantial alterations to the HUC boundary were  confirmed on the topographic maps.  Next, arcs from the extracted  coverage were grouped in order to examine the connectivity of the  dataset for flow determination.  In some cases it was necessary  to correct digitizing errors.  Using available evidence or  cartographic judgment, lines called connectors were added to join  features that were determined to have flow between each other.   All arcs were directed downstream and nodes were prepared to help  create artificial paths through 2-D waterbodies and complete the  flow through the hydrography network.  The artificial path  coverage was combined with the single line stream network to  create the drainage network.  The drainage network was grouped  again, and each group was directed downstream.  Feature codes  (fcodes) were assigned to landmark, network, waterbody features  through a crosswalk that converts DLG attributes to fcodes, where  an fcode is a five digit integer that encodes a set of feature  type characteristics.  Reach codes and associated attributes were  conflated from the 100K NHD data to the 24K drainage network and  2-D waterbodies.  Several checks were performed to validate the  reach transfer process.  Any reach codes that could not be  maintained are tracked in the Reach Cross Reference table (RCL).   New reaches that do not exist in the 100K data were defined  according to reach delineation rules (See http://nhd.usgs.gov/ chapter1/index.html).  New waterbody reaches were assigned to 2-D  lake/pond and reservoir features that do not exist in the 100K NHD.   New reaches were assigned reach code values that are sequentially  ordered to 2-D and then 1-D reaches.  New 24K reach codes are  larger than any existing 100K reach code in the associated  subbasin.  Additional geographic names that exist in the  Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) were added to reaches  in the 24K dataset.  Names for the 24K drainage network were  interactively transferred from the vector GNIS coverage.   Additional GNIS names for point and waterbody features were also  added.",6/29/2006,"The accuracy of the attributes of the source Digital Line Graph  (DLG) data is estimated to be 98.5 percent.  One or more of the  following methods were used to test attribute accuracy:  manual  comparison of the source with hardcopy plots; symbolized display  of the DLG on an interactive computer graphic system; selected  attributes that could not be visually verified on plots or on  screen were interactively queried and verified on screen.  In  addition, software validated feature types and characteristics  against a master set of types and characteristics, checked that  combinations of types and characteristics were valid, and that  types and characteristics were valid for the delineation of the  feature.  Feature types, characteristics, and other attributes  conform to the Standards for National Hydrography Dataset - High  Resolution (USGS, 1999) as of the date they were loaded into the  database.  All names on the 1:24,000-scale reaches were validated  against a current extract from the Geographic Names Information  System (GNIS).  The entry and identifier for the names match  those in GNIS.  The association of each name to reaches has been  interactively checked, however, operator error could in some  cases apply a name to a wrong reach.","Points, nodes, lines, and areas conform to topological rules.   Lines intersect only at nodes, and all nodes anchor the ends  of lines.  Lines do not overshoot or undershoot other lines  where they are supposed to meet.  There are no duplicate lines.  Lines bound areas and lines identify the areas to the left and  right of the lines.  Gaps and overlaps among areas do not  exist.  All areas close.","The completeness of the data reflects the published USGS  topographic quadrangle usually, supplemented by Digital  Orthophoto Quadrangles (DOQs).  Features found on the ground may  have been eliminated or generalized on the source map because  of scale and legibility constraints.  In general, streams longer  than one mile (approximately 1.6 kilometers) were collected.  Most streams that flow from a lake were collected regardless  of their length.  Only definite channels were collected so  not all swamp/marsh features have stream/rivers delineated  through them.  Lake/ponds 100 feet or greater in the shortest  axis were collected.  Note, however, that these general rules  were applied unevenly among maps during compilation.  Transport reaches are defined on nearly all features of type  stream/river, canal/ditch, artificial path, and connector.   Waterbody reaches are defined on all lake/pond features.  Detailed  capture conditions are provided for every feature type in the  Standards for National Hydrography Dataset - High Resolution  (USGS, 1999), available online through  http://mapping.usgs.gov/standards/.","Statements of horizontal positional accuracy are based on  accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic  quadrangle maps.  These maps were compiled to meet National Map  Accuracy Standards.  For horizontal accuracy, this standard is  met if at least 90 percent of points tested are within 0.02  inch (at map scale) of the true position.  Additional offsets  to positions may have been introduced where feature density is  high to improve the legibility of map symbols.  In addition, the  digitizing of maps is estimated to contain a horizontal  positional error of less than or equal to 0.003 inch standard  error (at map scale) in the two component directions relative  to the source maps.  Visual comparison between the map graphic  (including digital scans of the graphic) and plots or digital  displays of points, lines, and areas, is used as control to  assess the positional accuracy of digital data.  Digital map  elements along the adjoining edges of datasets are aligned if  they are within a 0.02 inch tolerance (at map scale).  Features  with like dimensionality (for example, features that all are  delineated with lines), with or without like characteristics,  that are within the tolerance are aligned by moving the  features equally to a common point.  Features outside the  tolerance are not moved; instead, a feature type of connector  is added to join the features.","Statements of vertical positional accuracy for elevation of  water surfaces are based on accuracy statements made for  U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps.  These  maps were compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards.   For vertical accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90  percent of well-defined points tested are within one-half  contour interval of the correct value.  Elevations of water  surface printed on the published map meet this standard;  the contour intervals of the maps vary.  These elevations  were transcribed into the digital data; the accuracy of  this transcription was checked by visual comparison between  the data and the map.","FGDC Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata, ver.2",FGDC-STD-001-1998,6/29/2006,U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency,U.S. Geological Survey,Mailing and Physical Address,Mid-Continent Mapping Center - 1400 Independence Road,Rolla,Missouri,65401,(573) 308-3647,"Monday-Friday, 7AM-3PM CST",None

367,10510,10510," Create high-resolution NHD from revised CDOW data.  This  process started with CDOW 1:24,000-scale hydrography files. CDOW datasets were converted to DLG-3 files using a custom converter supplied by Bill Kaiser 916-379-3736.  DLG files were then converted to NHD datasets using the 3-to-F process. These files were then edited to remove any conversion errors.  Once all of the Hi-resolution datasets were generated then a  Hi-resolution CU was created using one of two paths.  The first path loaded all of the quad NHD datasets into the FOD and then unloaded a Hi-resolution CU dataset. The second path used FTI to generate the Hi-resolution CU by combining the quad based datasets into a single CU dataset. During this combination any of the 1-D features with the same feature type were snapped  together using a user specified tolerance. After combining the datasets, all of the features that fall outside the 100K HUC boundary were removed. At this point any additional connectors were added to the data. After the Hi-resolution CU was generated, if was conflated to  the appropriate 100K CU. Prior to the actual conflation all of  the Hi-resolution are directions where modified to be directed downstream. Next conflation was performed to conflate reach codes  and associated flow relationships from the 100K NHD data to the  Hi-Resoultion dataset. After the conflation process, editing was performed to correct any conflation errors. At this point new network and 2-D waterbody reaches and associated flow were added  to the dataset.

368,12433,12433," Create high-resolution NHD from revised DLG data.  This  process started with published 1:24,000-scale USGS DLG hydrography files and used DOQs to revise the data.  Features  were modified to the DOQ only where compelling evidence of  change existed. DLG files were converted to ArcInfo coverages  and projected to a common projection (Albers NAD83 meters).   Coverages were then panelled into one coverage and arcs within  12 meters of each other along the neatline were snapped together if the feature type were the same.  Next, the 11-digit Hydrologic  Unit Code (HUC) boundary was obtained from the state NRCS office.   The HUC boundary was projected to the Albers projection and used  to extract features from the paneled coverage that fell partially  or entirely within the boundary.  Where necessary, the HUC  boundary was slightly modified to completely include or exclude features that incorrectly overlapped the boundary.  Substantial alterations to the HUC boundary were confirmed on the topographic maps. Next, arcs from the extracted coverage were grouped in  order to examine the connectivity of the data set for flow  determination.  In some cases it was necessary to correct  digitizing errors.  Using available evidence or cartographic  judgement, lines called connectors were added to join features  that were deemed to have flow between each other.  All arcs were  directed downstream and the nodes were prepared to help create  artificial paths through 2-D waterbodies and complete the flow through the hydrography network.  The artificial path coverage  was combined with the single line stream network to create the drainage network.  The drainage network was grouped again, and  each group was directed downstream.  Feature codes (fcodes) were assigned to landmark, network, waterbody features through a  crosswalk that converts DLG-3 attributes to fcodes, where an  fcode is a five digit integer that encodes a set of feature type characteristics.  Reach codes and associated attributes were  conflated from the 100K NHD data to the 24K drainage network  and 2-D waterbodies.  Several checks were performed to validate  the reach transfer process.Any reach codes that could not be  maintained are tracked in the Reach Cross Reference table.

378,25890,25890," Create high-resolution NHD from revised DLG data.  This  process started with published 1:24,000-scale USGS DLG hydrography files and used DOQs to revise the data.  Features  were modified to the DOQ only where compelling evidence of  change existed. DLG files were converted to ArcInfo coverages  and projected to a common projection (Albers NAD83 meters).   Coverages were then panelled into one coverage and arcs within  12 meters of each other along the neatline were snapped together if the feature type were the same.  Next, the 11-digit Hydrologic  Unit Code (HUC) boundary was obtained from the state NRCS office.   The HUC boundary was projected to the Albers projection and used  to extract features from the paneled coverage that fell partially  or entirely within the boundary.  Where necessary, the HUC  boundary was slightly modified to completely include or exclude features that incorrectly overlapped the boundary.  Substantial alterations to the HUC boundary were confirmed on the topographic maps. Next, arcs from the extracted coverage were grouped in  order to examine the connectivity of the data set for flow  determination.  In some cases it was necessary to correct  digitizing errors.  Using available evidence or cartographic  judgement, lines called connectors were added to join features  that were deemed to have flow between each other.  All arcs were  directed downstream and the nodes were prepared to help create  artificial paths through 2-D waterbodies and complete the flow through the hydrography network.  The artificial path coverage  was combined with the single line stream network to create the drainage network.  The drainage network was grouped again, and  each group was directed downstream.  Feature codes (fcodes) were assigned to landmark, network, waterbody features through a  crosswalk that converts DLG-3 attributes to fcodes, where an  fcode is a five digit integer that encodes a set of feature type characteristics.  Reach codes and associated attributes were  conflated from the 100K NHD data to the 24K drainage network  and 2-D waterbodies.  Several checks were performed to validate  the reach transfer process.Any reach codes that could not be  maintained are tracked in the Reach Cross Reference table.  New reaches that do not exist in the 100K data were defined  according to reach delineation rules (See  http://nhd.usgs.gov/chapter1/index.html).  New waterbody reaches were assigned to 2-D lake/pond and reservoir features that do not exist in the 100K NHD.  New reaches were assigned reach code values  that are sequentially ordered to 2-D and then 1-D reaches.  New 24K reach codes are larger than any existing 100K reach code in the associated Catalog Unit. Additional Geographic Names that  exist in the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) were added  to reaches in the 24K dataset. Names for the 24K drainage network  were interactively transferred from the vector GNIS coverage.   Additional GNIS names for point and waterbody features were also  added.

Features  were modified to the DOQ only where compelling evidence of  change existed. DLG files were converted to NHD datasets using the 3-to-F process. These files were then edited to remove any conversion errors and to add any required centerlines.  Once all of the Hi-resolution datasets were generated then a  Hi-resolution CU was created using one of two paths.  The first path loaded all of the quad NHD datasets into the FOD and then unloaded a Hi-resolution CU dataset. The second path used FTI to generate the Hi-resolution CU by combining the quad based datasets into a single CU dataset. During this combination any of the 1-D features with the same feature type were snapped  together using a user specified tolerance. After combining the datasets, all of the features that fall outside the 100K HUC boundary were removed. At this point any additional connectors were added to the data. After the Hi-resolution CU was generated, if was conflated to  the appropriate 100K CU. Prior to the actual conflation all of  the Hi-resolution are directions where modified to be directed downstream. Next conflation was performed to conflate reach codes  and associated flow relationships from the 100K NHD data to the  Hi-Resoultion dataset. After the conflation process, editing was performed to correct any conflation errors. At this point new network and 2-D waterbody reaches and associated flow were added  to the dataset.

This process started with 1:24,000-scale U.S. Forest  Service hydrography CFFs and 1:24,000-scale published USGS DLG  hydrography files.  The CFF files and DLG files were converted to  ArcInfo coverages and projected to a common projection (Albers,  NAD83, meters).  Coverages were then paneled into one coverage and  arcs within 12 meters of each other along the neatline were snapped  together if the feature types were the same.  Next, the 10-digit  Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) boundary was obtained from the State  NRCS office.  The HUC boundary was projected to the Albers  projection and used to extract features from the paneled coverage  that fell partially or entirely within the boundary.  Where  necessary, the HUC boundary was slightly modified to completely  include or exclude features that incorrectly overlapped the  boundary.  Substantial alterations to the HUC boundary were  confirmed on the topographic maps.  Next, arcs from the extracted  coverage were grouped in order to examine the connectivity of the  dataset for flow determination.  In some cases it was necessary  to correct digitizing errors.  Using available evidence or  cartographic judgement, lines called connectors were added to join  features that were deemed to have flow between each other.  All  arcs were directed downstream and the nodes were prepared to help  create artificial paths through 2-D waterbodies and complete the  flow through the hydrography network.  The artificial path  coverage was combined with the single line stream network to  create the drainage network.  The drainage network was grouped  again, and each group was directed downstream.  Feature codes  (fcodes) were assigned to landmark, network, waterbody features  through a crosswalk that converts DLG-3 attributes to fcodes,  where an fcode is a five digit integer that encodes a set of  feature type characteristics.

Coverages were then panelled into one coverage and arcs within  12 meters of each other along the neatline were snapped together if the feature type were the same.  Next, the 10-digit Hydrologic  Unit Code (HUC) boundary was obtained from the state NRCS office.   The HUC boundary was projected to the Albers projection and used  to extract features from the paneled coverage that fell partially  or entirely within the boundary.  Where necessary, the HUC  boundary was slightly modified to completely include or exclude features that incorrectly overlapped the boundary.  Substantial alterations to the HUC boundary were confirmed on the topographic maps. Next, arcs from the extracted coverage were grouped in  order to examine the connectivity of the data set for flow  determination.  In some cases it was necessary to correct  digitizing errors.  Using available evidence or cartographic  judgement, lines called connectors were added to join features  that were deemed to have flow between each other.

456,31103,31103,"Create high-resolution NHD from revised DLG data.  This process  started with published 1:24,000-scale USGS hydrography DLG files  and used DOQs to revise the data.  Features were modified to the  DOQ only where compelling evidence of change existed.  DLG files  were converted to ArcInfo coverages and projected to a common  projection (Albers, NAD83, meters).  Coverages were then paneled  into one coverage and arcs within 12 meters of each other along  the neatline were snapped together if the feature types were the  same.  Next, the 10-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) boundary was  obtained from the State NRCS office.  The HUC boundary was  projected to Albers and used to extract features from the paneled  coverage that fell partially or entirely within the boundary.   Where necessary, the HUC boundary was slightly modified to  completely include or exclude features that incorrectly overlapped  the boundary.  Substantial alterations to the HUC boundary were  confirmed on the topographic maps.  Next, arcs from the extracted  coverage were grouped in order to examine the connectivity of the  dataset for flow determination.  In some cases it was necessary  to correct digitizing errors.  Using available evidence or  cartographic judgment, lines called connectors were added to join  features that were determined to have flow between each other.   All arcs were directed downstream and nodes were prepared to help  create artificial paths through 2-D waterbodies and complete the  flow through the hydrography network.  The artificial path  coverage was combined with the single line stream network to  create the drainage network.  The drainage network was grouped  again, and each group was directed downstream.  Feature codes  (fcodes) were assigned to landmark, network, waterbody features  through a crosswalk that converts DLG attributes to fcodes, where  an fcode is a five digit integer that encodes a set of feature  type characteristics.  Reach codes and associated attributes were  conflated from the 100K NHD data to the 24K drainage network and  2-D waterbodies.  Several checks were performed to validate the  reach transfer process.

Visual  comparison between the map graphic (including digital scans of  the graphic) and plots or digital displays of points, lines, and  areas, is used as control to assess the positional accuracy of  digital data.  Digital map elements along the adjoining edges of  datasets are aligned if they are within a 0.02 inch tolerance (at  map scale).  Features with like dimensionality (for example,  features that all are delineated with lines), with or without  like characteristics, that are within the tolerance are aligned  by moving the features equally to a common point.  Features  outside the tolerance are not moved; instead, a feature type of  connector is added to join the features.","Statements of vertical positional accuracy for elevation of  water surfaces are based on accuracy statements made for  U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps.  These  maps were compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards.   For vertical accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90  percent of well-defined points tested are within one-half  contour interval of the correct value.  Elevations of water  surface printed on the published map meet this standard;  the contour intervals of the maps vary.  These elevations  were transcribed into the digital data; the accuracy of  this transcription was checked by visual comparison between  the data and the map.","FGDC Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata, ver.2",FGDC-STD-001-1998,7/31/2006,"U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency and Maine Office of Geographic Information  Systems",U.S. Geological Survey,Mailing and Physical Address,Mid-Continent Mapping Center - 1400 Independence Road,Rolla,Missouri,65401,(573) 308-3647,"Monday-Friday, 7AM-3PM CST",None

One or more of the  following methods were used to test attribute accuracy:  manual  comparison of the source with hardcopy plots; symbolized display  of the DLG on an interactive computer graphic system; selected  attributes that could not be visually verified on plots or on  screen were interactively queried and verified on screen.  In  addition, software validated feature types and characteristics  against a master set of types and characteristics, checked that  combinations of types and characteristics were valid, and that  types and characteristics were valid for the delineation of the  feature.  Feature types, characteristics, and other attributes  conform to the Standards for National Hydrography Dataset - High  Resolution (USGS, 1999) as of the date they were loaded into the  database.  All names on the 1:24,000-scale reaches were validated  against a current extract from the Geographic Names Information  System (GNIS).  The entry and identifier for the names match  those in GNIS.  The association of each name to reaches has been  interactively checked, however, operator error could in some  cases apply a name to a wrong reach.","Points, nodes, lines, and areas conform to topological rules.   Lines intersect only at nodes, and all nodes anchor the ends  of lines.  Lines do not overshoot or undershoot other lines  where they are supposed to meet.  There are no duplicate lines.  Lines bound areas and lines identify the areas to the left and  right of the lines.  Gaps and overlaps among areas do not  exist.  All areas close.","The completeness of the data reflects the published USGS  topographic quadrangle usually, supplemented by Digital  Orthophoto Quadrangles (DOQs).  Features found on the ground may  have been eliminated or generalized on the source map because  of scale and legibility constraints.  In general, streams longer  than one mile (approximately 1.6 kilometers) were collected.  Most streams that flow from a lake were collected regardless  of their length.  Only definite channels were collected so  not all swamp/marsh features have stream/rivers delineated  through them.  Lake/ponds 100 feet or greater in the shortest  axis were collected.  Note, however, that these general rules  were applied unevenly among maps during compilation.  Transport reaches are defined on nearly all features of type  stream/river, canal/ditch, artificial path, and connector.   Waterbody reaches are defined on all lake/pond features.  Detailed  capture conditions are provided for every feature type in the  Standards for National Hydrography Dataset - High Resolution  (USGS, 1999), available online through  http://mapping.usgs.gov/standards/.","Statements of horizontal positional accuracy are based on  accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic  quadrangle maps.  These maps were compiled to meet National Map  Accuracy Standards.  For horizontal accuracy, this standard is  met if at least 90 percent of points tested are within 0.02  inch (at map scale) of the true position.  Additional offsets  to positions may have been introduced where feature density is  high to improve the legibility of map symbols.  In addition, the  digitizing of maps is estimated to contain a horizontal  positional error of less than or equal to 0.003 inch standard  error (at map scale) in the two component directions relative  to the source maps.  Visual comparison between the map graphic  (including digital scans of the graphic) and plots or digital  displays of points, lines, and areas, is used as control to  assess the positional accuracy of digital data.

In  addition, software validated feature types and  characteristics against a master set of types and  characteristics,checked that combinations of types and  characteristics were valid, and that types and  characteristics were valid for the delineation of the  feature. Feature types, characteristics, and other  attributes conform to the Standards for National  Hydrography Dataset - High Resolution (USGS, 1999) as of  the date they were loaded into the database. All names  on the 1:24,000-scale reaches were validated against a  April 1999 extract from the Geographic Names Information  System. The entry and identifier for the names match those  in the Geographic Names Information System. The association  of each name to reaches has been interactively checked  against the April 1999 Geographic Names Information System  names extract, however, operator error could in some cases  apply a name to a wrong reach.   For CDOW data, the attribute accuracy is unknown. "," Points, nodes, lines, and areas conform to topological rules.   Lines intersect only at nodes, and all nodes anchor the ends  of lines.  Lines do not overshoot or undershoot other lines  where they are supposed to meet. There are no duplicate lines.  Lines bound areas and lines identify the areas to the left and  right of the lines.  Gaps and overlaps among areas do not  exist.  All areas close."," For DLG-3 data, the completeness of the data reflects the published map.  Features found on the ground may have been  eliminated or generalized on the source graphic because of  scale and legibility constraints. In general, streams longer  than one mile (approximately 1.6 kilometers) were collected.  Most streams that flow from a lake were collected regardless  of their length. Only definite channels were collected so  not all swamp/marsh features have stream/rivers delineated  through them.  Lake/ponds 100 feet or greater in the shortest  axis were collected.  Note, however, that these general rules  were applied unevenly among maps during compilation. Transport reaches are defined on nearly all features of type stream/river, canal/ditch, artificial path, and connector. Detailed capture   conditions are provided for every feature type in the Standards  for National Hydrography Dataset - High Resolution (USGS, 1999), available online through http://mapping.usgs.gov/standards/. Completeness of CDOW data is unknown."," For DLG-3 data, statements of horizontal positional accuracy are based on  accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic  quadrangle maps. These maps were compiled to meet National Map  Accuracy Standards. For horizontal accuracy, this standard is  met if at least 90 percent of points tested are within 0.02  inch (at map scale) of the true position.  Additional offsets  to positions may have been introduced where feature density is  high to improve the legibility of map symbols.In addition, the  digitizing of maps is estimated to contain a horizontal  positional error of less than or equal to 0.003 inch standard  error(at map scale) in the two component directions relative  to the source maps.  Visual comparison between the map graphic  (including digital scans of the graphic) and plots or digital  displays of points, lines, and areas, is used as control to  assess the positional accuracy of digital data. Digital map  elements along the adjoining edges of data sets are aligned if  they are within a 0.02 inch tolerance (at map scale). Features  with like dimensionality (for example, features that all are  delineated with lines), with or without like characteristics,  that are within the tolerance are aligned by moving the  features equally to a common point. Features outside the  tolerance are not moved; instead, a feature of type connector  is added to join the features. The horizontal positional accuracy of the CDOW data is unknown."," For DLG-3 data, statements of vertical positional accuracy for elevation of  water surfaces are  based on accuracy statements made for  U.S. Geological Survey topographicquadrangle maps.  These  maps were compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards.   For vertical accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90  percent of well-defined points tested are within one-half  contour interval of the correct value.  Elevations of water  surface printed on the published map meet this standard;  the contour intervals of the maps vary.

617,26633,26633," Create high-resolution NHD from revised DLG data.  This  process started with published 1:24,000-scale USGS DLG hydrography files and used DOQs to revise the data.  Features  were modified to the DOQ only where compelling evidence of  change existed. DLG files were converted to NHD datasets using the 3-to-F process. These files were then edited to remove any conversion errors and to add any required centerlines.  Once all of the Hi-resolution datasets were generated then a  Hi-resolution CU was created using one of two paths.  The first path loaded all of the quad NHD datasets into the FOD and then unloaded a Hi-resolution CU dataset. The second path used FTI to generate the Hi-resolution CU by combining the quad based datasets into a single CU dataset. During this combination any of the 1-D features with the same feature type were snapped  together using a user specified tolerance. After combining the datasets, all of the features that fall outside the 100K HUC boundary were removed. At this point any additional connectors were added to the data. After the Hi-resolution CU was generated, if was conflated to  the appropriate 100K CU. Prior to the actual conflation all of  the Hi-resolution are directions where modified to be directed downstream. Next conflation was performed to conflate reach codes  and associated flow relationships from the 100K NHD data to the  Hi-Resoultion dataset. After the conflation process, editing was performed to correct any conflation errors. At this point new network and 2-D waterbody reaches and associated flow were added  to the dataset. Appropriate stream levels and flow sequences were then applied.       Additional Geographic Names were applied using the appropriate Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) source coverages.

626,27314,27314," Create high-resolution NHD from revised DLG data.  This  process started with published 1:24,000-scale USGS DLG hydrography files and used DOQs to revise the data.  Features  were modified to the DOQ only where compelling evidence of  change existed. DLG files were converted to NHD datasets using the 3-to-F process. These files were then edited to remove any conversion errors and to add any required centerlines.  Once all of the Hi-resolution datasets were generated then a  Hi-resolution CU was created using one of two paths.  The first path loaded all of the quad NHD datasets into the FOD and then unloaded a Hi-resolution CU dataset. The second path used FTI to generate the Hi-resolution CU by combining the quad based datasets into a single CU dataset. During this combination any of the 1-D features with the same feature type were snapped  together using a user specified tolerance. After combining the datasets, all of the features that fall outside the 100K HUC boundary were removed. At this point any additional connectors were added to the data. After the Hi-resolution CU was generated, if was conflated to  the appropriate 100K CU. Prior to the actual conflation all of  the Hi-resolution are directions where modified to be directed downstream. Next conflation was performed to conflate reach codes  and associated flow relationships from the 100K NHD data to the  Hi-Resoultion dataset. After the conflation process, editing was performed to correct any conflation errors. At this point new network and 2-D waterbody reaches and associated flow were added  to the dataset.

632,27384,27384," Create high-resolution NHD from revised DLG data.  This  process started with published 1:24,000-scale USGS DLG hydrography files and used DOQs to revise the data.  Features  were modified to the DOQ only where compelling evidence of  change existed. DLG files were converted to ArcInfo coverages  and projected to a common projection (Albers NAD83 meters).   Coverages were then panelled into one coverage and arcs within  12 meters of each other along the neatline were snapped together if the feature type were the same.  Next, the 11-digit Hydrologic  Unit Code (HUC) boundary was obtained from the state NRCS office.   The HUC boundary was projected to the Albers projection and used  to extract features from the paneled coverage that fell partially  or entirely within the boundary.  Where necessary, the HUC  boundary was slightly modified to completely include or exclude features that incorrectly overlapped the boundary.  Substantial alterations to the HUC boundary were confirmed on the topographic maps. Next, arcs from the extracted coverage were grouped in  order to examine the connectivity of the data set for flow  determination.  In some cases it was necessary to correct  digitizing errors.  Using available evidence or cartographic  judgement, lines called connectors were added to join features  that were deemed to have flow between each other.  All arcs were  directed downstream and the nodes were prepared to help create  artificial paths through 2-D waterbodies and complete the flow through the hydrography network.  The artificial path coverage  was combined with the single line stream network to create the drainage network.  The drainage network was grouped again, and  each group was directed downstream.  Feature codes (fcodes) were assigned to landmark, network, waterbody features through a  crosswalk that converts DLG-3 attributes to fcodes, where an  fcode is a five digit integer that encodes a set of feature type characteristics.  Reach codes and associated attributes were  conflated from the 100K NHD data to the 24K drainage network  and 2-D waterbodies.  Several checks were performed to validate  the reach transfer process.Any reach codes that could not be  maintained are tracked in the Reach Cross Reference table.  New reaches that do not exist in the 100K data were defined  according to reach delineation rules (See  http://nhd.usgs.gov/chapter1/index.html).  New waterbody reaches were assigned to 2-D lake/pond and reservoir features that do not exist in the 100K NHD.  New reaches were assigned reach code values  that are sequentially ordered to 2-D and then 1-D reaches.  New 24K reach codes are larger than any existing 100K reach code in the associated Catalog Unit. Additional Geographic Names that  exist in the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) were added  to reaches in the 24K dataset. Names for the 24K drainage network  were interactively transferred from the vector GNIS coverage.   Additional GNIS names for point and waterbody features were also  added.

644,29106,29106,"Create high-resolution NHD from revised CDOW data. This process started with CDOW 1:24,000-scale hydrography files. CDOW datasets were converted to DLG-3 files using a custom converter supplied by Bill Kaiser 916-379-3736. DLG files were then converted to NHD datasets using the 3-to-F process. These files were then edited to remove any conversion errors. Once all of the Hi-resolution datasets were generated then a Hi-resolution CU was created using one of two paths. The first path loaded all of the quad NHD datasets into the FOD and then unloaded a Hi-resolution CU dataset. The second path used FTI to generate the Hi-resolution CU by combining the quad based datasets into a single CU dataset. During this combination any of the 1-D features with the same feature type were snapped together using a user specified tolerance. After combining the datasets, all of the features that fall outside the 100K HUC boundary were removed. At this point any additional connectors were added to the data. After the Hi-resolution CU was generated, if was conflated to the appropriate 100K CU. Prior to the actual conflation all of the Hi-resolution are directions where modified to be directed downstream. Next conflation was performed to conflate reach codes and associated flow relationships from the 100K NHD data to the Hi-Resoultion dataset. After the conflation process, editing was performed to correct any conflation errors. At this point new network and 2-D waterbody reaches and associated flow were added to the dataset.

654,30865,30865,"Create high-resolution NHD from revised DLG data.  This process  started with 1:24,000-scale DLG hydrography files.  Using either  Kansas Geological Survey's (KGS) digital line graph (DLG) for UTM  or standard USGS 7.5' quadrangles as backdrop for extent, streams  were digitized from 1:12,000-scale DOQs.  Only stream placement was  digitized.  Care was taken to ensure that stream direction was taken  into account when digitizing.  The only extent that was updated from  the backdrop was disappearing streams.  All disappearing streams  that are contained in the backdrop, but contained a definite  drainage channel on the DOQ, were connected to the major stream.   If there was any question as to stream placement, the backdrop was  strictly adhered to.  Double line streams were digitized from the  backdrop even if streams were covered with trees.  Double line  streams were attributed according to stream direction either as the  left bank or the right bank.  Double line streams next to the State  line were digitized as one bank (according to direction) with a  digitized centerline (attributed as perennial), in order to close  the polygon.  Sandbar islands were not digitized, but shallow  sandbars were included as part of the stream channel.  All islands  that could be seen at 1:4800-scale on the DOQs were digitized and  attributed as perennial.  All ponds, that could be seen at 1:4800- scale on the DOQs and were greater that 0.5 acres, were digitized.   Ponds that were on the backdrop, but could not be seen on the DOQs,  were not digitized.  Ponds were digitized from DOQs at their  perennial water level.  Sewage lagoons were digitized from DOQs at  a scale of 1:4800.  The lagoons were labeled as man-made and were  coded	as lagoon.  Agricultural waste systems were digitized if there  was a distinct, confined livestock area with a defined lagoon  structure.  Agricultural waste ponds were coded as man-made and  labeled as lagoon.  Quarries were digitized if there was either:  a distinct environment conclusive to quarries, as seen on the DOQs,  or after referring to USGS 7.5' quadrangles and the area in question  had at one time contained a quarry.  Quarries were coded as man-made  and were labeled as water.  Industrial ponds were digitized, if they  were contained in an urban, industrial environment.  Industrial ponds  were coded as man-made and labeled as water.  Ditches were digitized  if backdrop included the ditches in	their layer.  Canals were  digitized if backdrop was conclusive to a stream.  Wetlands were not  digitized unless specifically displayed on USGS 7.5' quadrangles as  a large, contiguous wetland with a size greater than 0.5 acres.   Wetlands were coded as natural and labeled as water.  The stream  digitizing was documented in the following ways:  backcover  quadrangle date and photorevision data, digitized completion date,  and estimated time of completion.  All hydrography was check plotted  at the 7.5' quad format and was overlaid on USGS 7.5' quadrangle maps  to ensure:  hydrography placement, hydrography direction, and  hydrography type.  Through on-screen checks, the following were  checked:  edge-match problems, dangles, pseudo nodes, sliver polygons,  multiple labels, and built topology.  All quads were spot checked by  an inner office review.  Automated procedures checked for the  following errors:  polygon, and line topology, multiple label points  within a polygon, unlabeled polygons, pseudo nodes, dangling nodes,  sliver polygons, and edge matching.  Features were modified to the  DOQ only where compelling evidence of change existed.  DLG files  were converted to ArcInfo coverages and projected to a common  projection (Albers, NAD83, meters).  Coverages were then paneled  into one coverage and arcs within 12 meters of each other along the  neatline were snapped together if the feature types were the same.

If necessary, artificial paths and/or 1-D stream/rivers that were related to or in proximity to the revised 2-D features were edited to maintain flow and conform to the rules of the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD).  These updates were completed by USGS personnel as part of a national update program begun in 2009 to help align prominent features with the orthoimages being used for US Topo product.",8/23/2010,None,None,None,None,None,None,FGDC-STD-001-1998,8/23/2010,U.S. Geological Survey,U.S. Geological Survey,Mailing and Physical,"U.S. Geological Survey, National Geospatial Technical Operations Center, P.O.
